Description: 

Checkers is a two-player board game played on an 8x8 grid, using red and white pieces. Players alternate moves, diagonally advancing pieces towards the opponent's side.
Reaching the far end transforms a piece into a "king," allowing it to move both forwards and backwards. Captures are made by jumping over an opponent's piece, with 
multiple jumps allowed if successive captures are possible. The game ends when one player loses all their pieces. The application tracking this game also records 
wins and allows game states to be saved and resumed.
